#+TITLE: Releasing Process Documentation

* Brief description about the releasing process

  The releasing process of these ports follows a similar structure to the one that
  Sailfish OS has.

  A release is developed, tested  and than branched of into a new release.
  Each release has it's on repositories separated from each other.

  The release process is usually started directly after a new public
  release for Sailfish OS has been released or if possible already started
  earlier if possible by following the state of the related port if it exists.


* Create a new story for the release
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CREATED:  [2022-12-01 Thu 01:1]
  :END:

  Create a new story for the release, use an existing release story
  as a template.


* Branching of a new release
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CREATED:  [2022-12-01 Thu 00:40]
  :END:

  After the initial testing run ~osc_release_branch.sh~ like this:
  #+begin_src sh
  ./osc_release_branch.sh -P <source_project> -T <target_project> -R <new release>
  #+end_src

** Caveats when branching of a release
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CREATED:  [2022-12-01 Thu 02:10]
   :END:

   Some caveats have to be taken into account when a new release.

   In case we need a new feature that isn't a in the current Sailfish OS release
   such as support for new hardware the packages needed have to added to the new branch
   in case they were not added beforehand to the devel project.

   For some packages special measurements have to be taken:
   - Packages that depend on droidmedia-devel have to be rebuild if droidmedia is newer
     than droidmedia-devel in Sailfish OS ([[https://github.com/SailfishOS-SonyXperia/bugs/issues/57][SailfishOS-SonyXperia/bugs#57]]).


* Final testing for the release

  :ID:       1e1f4bf2-1ac3-45cc-8fa8-12b01b6c2d72
  :END:

  After the release has been branched of create a new release image to test it.
  Run ~hadk.tools.mkimage.sh~ with the repository you just branched of, install
  the image to your device and run CSD.

  To start CSD please follow this link:
  [[https://jolla.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201441067-CSD-tool-for-customer-service-diagnostic][CSD tool for customer service diagnostic â€“ Jolla Service and Support]]

  Select run continuous testing to run all tests and follow the instructions
  until the tests are done.

  Write down all the known issues that can't be fixed right now by creating a bug
  for each.

  If all tests have passed that can pass right now continue to the next step.

  In case there are issues try to work on the specific issue and repeat the tests that
  have failed.
  Try to write descriptive bug reports and report to upstream if needed.

  # FIXME Add description on how to report bugs to Jolla. SailfishOS docs?

  Replace old release with the last release and new release with the release you just tested.

* Create a bug for the known issues of the new release
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CREATED:  [2022-12-01 Thu 01:2]
  :END:

  Create a new bug for the known issues for this release that can't be fixed right now.

  Check the post of the previous release for known issues that haven't been fixed
  and copy them to the new release post.


* Tag a new release and prepare the release changelog
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CREATED:  [2022-12-01 Thu 00:4]
  :END:

  Tag a new release in the ~droid-hal-version-$vendor-$family~ repository,
  e.g. for the Sony Xperia 1/5 -> ~droid-hal-version-sony-kumano~.

  The name of the tag should be ~<SailfishOS-Version>git<release revision>~
  so for example ~4.4.0.72git1~.

  This tag will be used to identify a new release.

  Create a new draft release by selecting "Draft a new release" in the
  repository mentioned above.

  Enter the following into the draft:
  #+begin_src org
  ,* Sailfish OS 4.4.0.68 for {{{VENDOR}}} {{{DEVICE_NAME_PRETTY}}}

  These release notes cover Sailfish OS {{RELEASE}} for the following devices:

  # Repeat if the device family consists of more than one device
  # {{{DEVICE_NAME_VARIANTS}}} should be a comma and space
  # separated list of all devices.

  - {{{DEVICE_NAME_PRETTY}}} ({{{DEVICE_NAME_VARIANTS}}})

  ,* Intro

    {{{INTRO_BRIEF}}}

    # If nessascary adjust the flashing instructions specific to the induvidual adaptation.
  To install Sailfish OS on your device please follow the install instructs in the flashing-readme.txt file included in the archive or read the offical flashing instructions for either the Xperia 10 II or Xperia 10 III:

      https://jolla.com/sailfishxinstall/

  Just make sure to download the software binaries for your device instead of the ones mentioned in the instructions:

  # Replaced the placeholder below with a link to the oem binaries of the vendor
  # for example for Xperia 1/5 Kumano:
  # https://developer.sony.com/file/download/software-binaries-for-aosp-android-10-0-kernel-4-14-kumano-latest
  {{{OEM_BINARIES_LINK}}}

  ,* Updating your device

  To update your device please follow the update instructions in INSTALL.org:
  [[https://github.com/SailfishOS-SonyXperia/bugs/blob/master/INSTALL.org#updating-your-device][INSTALL.org/Updating your device]]

  ,* Known issues

  # Replace list of known issues with the following format of known issue
  #
  # + Link with short name of the issue, usually <bugtracker>#<bugnumber>
  #   as description for the link.
  #   In case of Forges such as Github organisation/repository#<bugnumber>.
  #   - Short description of the issue
  #
  # Repeat this for all the known issues present.

  {{{LIST_OF_KNOW_ISSUES}}}

  ,* Changelog

    # Add a short note above the changelog if needed for example:
    # This is the first release for this device, thus the changelog is quite verbose.
    #
    # Then paste the contents of Changelog.md into the details section, strip the text
    # above the first heading.

    <details>
    {{{Paste changelog here}}}
    </details>


  #+end_src


Follow the instructions in the draft and replace the contents accordingly.
Attach /Changelog.md/ after you are done.


* Build a new release
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CREATED:  [2022-12-01 Thu 00:40]
  :END:

  Now since you created the release draft it is time to build the final images
  for all devices.

  Run ~hadk.tools.mkimage.sh~ without specifying the specific device you are building
  for, let it build for all devices

  After it is done check all the build log, check if all zip archives have the right size.
  The size should be around 700Mb.

  Now attach each archive created to the draft release you created earlier.

  If everything is alright continue with the next step.

* Aggregate release to release repository
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CREATED:  [2024-02-21 Wed 00:14]
  :END:

  After testing the new release and building images it is finally time to aggregate the new
  release so that existing others can upgrade.

  Execute the aggregate script like this:
  #+begin_src sh
  ./osc_aggregate_release_package.py -R <release_project> -C <release_config_project>
  #+end_src

* Publish
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CREATED:  [2022-12-01 Thu 00:50]
  :END:

  The final step is to publish and lean back :).

  Update each post you publish on with the brief intro to this release,
  update the known issues and adjust any other links if necessary.

  Change the title of the post to match the current release.

  If everything is done, publish the draft release and spread the news.
